Hello,

I am writing to request records from Eatonville Police department, under
the Washington Public Records Act, =C2=A742.56 et seq.

I am requesting the following:


1) The name and version of the record management software and/or system
(RMS) that your agency currently uses to maintain data on vehicle pursuits,
if any;

2) The year that your agency first began keeping track of data on vehicular
pursuits in an RMS if any, the name and version of the RMS used at that
time, and whether a continuous set of electronic records are currently
available since you first began recording pursuits in an RMS;;

3) A list of all vehicle pursuits that your agency was involved in from
2019 through 2023, including incident date, report number, and any/all
other RMS data fields that are not required to be redacted by law;

4) Policy manuals, rules, and regulations for your agency relating to
vehicle pursuits, including record-keeping and data collection on pursuits,
that were in effect between 2019 and 2023;

5) Reports, data and/or summary statistics, and analyses related to vehicle
pursuits produced by your agency between 2019 and 2023 in accordance with
your agency=E2=80=99s policies, rules, and regulations.

6) Internal and external publications by your agency (e.g. monthly/annual
reports, newsletters, materials provided to government officials) produced
between 2019 through 2023 containing vehicle pursuits data and/or summary
statistics;

7) Written reviews and analyses of vehicle pursuits, other than incident
reports, produced by your agency between 2019 through 2023 in accordance
CALEA accreditation standards and/or model policies; and

8) Written reviews and analyses of vehicle pursuits, other than incident
reports, produced by your agency between 2019 through 2023 pursuant to
local, state, or federal law;

Where possible, I would like the records provided electronically. This
information is not being sought for commercial purposes. The Washington
Public Records Act requires a response to this request be made within five
(5) business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take
longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about
when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.
If you deny part or all of my request, please cite each
specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the
information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under
the law.

Thank you for your assistance.


Best,

Shira Idris
