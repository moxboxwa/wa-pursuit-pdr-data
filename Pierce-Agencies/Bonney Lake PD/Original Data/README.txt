From correspondence:

We used a Microsoft word document prior to the recent year to track pursuits, until 2023 we switched to using an Excel Spreadsheet

It was also discovered that our 2021 pursuit documents had been inadvertently destroyed. 

There was only one pursuit in 2022 and there was not a log produced.
