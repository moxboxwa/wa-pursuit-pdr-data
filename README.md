## Projects

There are 3 projects:

* *County Sheriff's offices + WSP 1/2019 - 11/2023* -- this was the first set of PDRs, started in 11/2023, with almost all data received by 4/2024.  Data were stored in mm's Google drive and code is now being written to read those into R and compile a report.
    - Original files on [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJU0ctj5Fa5MnyLhujojLTabFAEcAj_c?usp=sharing)
* *WASPC/CALEA accredited agencies 2019-2023* -- Request for line-level pursuit incident data with all fields not required to be redacted by law.  Accredited agencies are required to collect this data.  Also requested copies of policy manuals and internal/external reports generated from the data.  
* *Pierce County agencies 2019-2023* -- More extensive request from agencies in each of the jurisdictions where the elected officials signed on to letters requesting rollback of the pursuit policy.  If the agency is accredited, we track it in that project.  If not, the PDR requested info on the status of pursuit data collected.

## Structure

Project / Agency / Content

Each project has a folder in the repository, with subfolders for each agency, and within the agency, subfolders for:

  * *Correspondence* -- All correspondence with the agency, including a copy of the initial request (b/c these may be tweaked over time and we need to have a record of what we asked for.)
  * *OriginalData* -- The original datafile(s) sent by the agency
  * *CleanData* -- An excel file with the cleaned data in harmonized format.  Line level incident data is stored in a tab named "Incidents", summary tabular data in a tab named "Table"
