* Each agency will have a folder in the repository.  The folder should contain subfolders for:
  * *Correspondence* -- All correspondence with the agency, including a copy of the initial request (b/c these may be tweaked over time and we need to have a record of what we asked for.)
  * *OriginalData* -- The original datafile(s) sent by the agency
  * *CleanData* -- An excel file with the cleaned data in harmonized format
 
* Agency status is tracked with a [project tracker](https://github.com/users/moxboxwa/projects/1/views/1)
