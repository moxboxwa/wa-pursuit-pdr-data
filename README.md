## Projects

There are 4 projects:

* *County Sheriff's offices + WSP 1/2019 - 11/2023* -- this was the first set of PDRs, started in 11/2023, with almost all data received by 4/2024.  Data were stored in mm's Google drive and code is now being written to read those into R and compile a report.
    - Original files on [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJU0ctj5Fa5MnyLhujojLTabFAEcAj_c?usp=sharing)
 
The remaining 3 projects are for 3 groups of agencies that were sent PDRs in 2024 for RMS line-level pursuit incident data from 2019-2023 with all fields not required to be redacted by law, copies of policy manuals for this period and all internal/external reports generated from the data. 
* *AWC Signatories* -- Agencies that signed the AWC letter to the State Leg requesting rollback of the pursuit policy.
* *WASPC/CALEA accredited agencies* -- Note that accredited agencies are required to collect/review this data annually.  
* *Pierce County agencies* --Agencies that signed the Pierce Co letter to the State Leg requesting rollback of the pursuit policy.

If the agency is accredited but also signed a letter, we track it in the letter project.

## Structure

Project / Agency / Content

Each project has a folder in the repository, with subfolders for each agency, and within the agency, subfolders for:

  * *Correspondence* -- All correspondence with the agency, including a copy of the initial request (b/c these may be tweaked over time and we need to have a record of what we asked for.)
  * *Policies* -- As sent by the agency
  * *Summaries* -- As sent by the agency - should be pursuit-related reports (annual and otherwise) but we got lots of other things under this rubric.
  * *Data* --
    - *Original* -- Folder with the original datafile(s) sent by the agency
    - *[agencyName].xlsx* -- An excel file with the cleaned data in harmonized format.  Line level incident data is stored in a tab named "Incidents", summary tabular data in a tab named "Table"
