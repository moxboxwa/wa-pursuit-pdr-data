This case was PDR'd by mistake as part of the PDR to clarify Benton Co SO pursuits.

BCSO did not include any of the fatal pursuit incidents in our fe-wapo dataset.  So we circled back to PDR BCSO for these cases.

Mercado was not one of the cases, but he died the same year, and with taser involvement, so he was accidentally misidentified (the person we should have identified was Samuel Gonzales)
